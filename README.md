Some numerical experiments to illustrate part of Lecture 1 in Keith Ball's "An Elementary Introduction to Modern Convex Geometry."  The relevant portions are highlighted yellow in Lecture 1 in [this version of the PDF](ball.pdf).

## Random sampling of uniformly distributed sphere

This is where we sample a uniformly distributed sphere of volume 1 in dimension N.  We only measure x_1 for each sample. Then, we plot the distribution of values of x_1.

If you run (sphere_sampling.m)[sphere_sampling.m] (Matlab script), it will generate the following figures:

1. (samples_x1.png)[samples_x1.png] - Illustrates the sampling process described above, for various values of N.
2. (samples_ellipse.png)[samples_ellipse.png] - Same as last item, but now in each dimension N, we use a randomly generated ellipse of volume 1 in that dimension, instead of a sphere. The ellipse is fixed for all samples in that dimension.
3. (pairwise_distance_distributions.png)[pairwise_distance_distributions.png] - Measures distribution of pairwise distances between points for each value N.
4. (pairwise_distance_distributions_ellipse.png)[pairwise_distance_distributions_ellipse.png] - Same as last item, but the ellipse version described in item #2.
5. (pairwise_distances_vs_N.png)[pairwise_distances_vs_N.png] - Mean distance between points as a function of N, for the scenarios shown in #1.
6. (sigma_vs_ellipse_cov_trials_fixed_N.png)[sigma_vs_ellipse_cov_trials_fixed_N.png] - For the experiments in #2, illustrates the sampled distribution sigma vs the (square root of) the ellipse axis length in the measured dimension.
