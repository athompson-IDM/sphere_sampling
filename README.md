# sphere_sampling

## What is this?

An illustration of the idea that a univariate normal random distribution is a one-dimensional projection of a uniform random distribution in a high-dimensional sphere.

And, that we can generalize the idea of a high-dimensional sphere to be a high-dimensional ellipsoid instead, and that the length of one of the ellipsoid's axes is connected to the variance of the associated one-dimensionally-projected univariate normal distribution.

## Huh?

These are some numerical experiments to illustrate part of Lecture 1 in Keith Ball's "An Elementary Introduction to Modern Convex Geometry."  The relevant portions are highlighted yellow in Lecture 1 in [this version of the PDF](ball.pdf).  The source version of the notes was retrieved [from here](http://library.msri.org/books/Book31/files/ball.pdf).

The code runs in Matlab. Tested in R2019b. It might work in Octave but I haven't tested that yet. If it doesn't run in Octave as-is, it probably only needs minor tweaks, because it doesn't use any fancy Matlab toolboxes or anything and it's pretty vanilla.

## Random sampling of uniformly distributed sphere of volume 1

This is where we sample a uniformly distributed sphere of volume 1 in dimension N.  We only measure x_1 for each sample. Then, we plot the distribution of values of x_1.

If you run [sphere_sampling.m](sphere_sampling.m) (Matlab script), it will generate the following figures:

1. [samples_x1.png](samples_x1.png) - Illustrates the sampling process described above, for various values of N.
2. [samples_ellipse.png](samples_ellipse.png) - Same as last item, but now in each dimension N, we use a randomly generated ellipse of volume 1 in that dimension, instead of a sphere. The ellipse is fixed for all samples in that dimension. As we vary N we are also generating a new ellipse each time, so there's really two things changing for each subplot.
3. [pairwise_distance_distributions.png](pairwise_distance_distributions.png) - Measures distribution of pairwise distances between points for each value N, for same experiments shown in #1.
4. [pairwise_distance_distributions_ellipse.png](pairwise_distance_distributions_ellipse.png) - Same as last item, but the ellipse version of the experiment described in item #2.
5. [pairwise_distances_vs_N.png](pairwise_distances_vs_N.png) - Mean distance between points as a function of N, for the scenarios shown in #1.

## Random sampling of uniformly distributed random ellipse of volume 1

Same as above, but now we squeeze the sphere into an ellipse, still of volume 1.  The length of the axes are randomly generated but constrained so that the volume of the ellipse is 1.

If you run [ellipse_sampling_fixed_N.m](ellipse_sampling_fixed_N.m), it will generate the following figures:

6. [sigma_vs_ellipse_cov_trials_fixed_N.png](sigma_vs_ellipse_cov_trials_fixed_N.png) - For a fixed N = 100, generates many random ellipses and does the same sampling process described above. Illustrates the sampled distribution sigma vs the (square root of) the ellipse axis length in the measured dimension.
7. [coplot_sampled_ellipse_w_normal_dist_of_equivalent_sigma.png](coplot_sampled_ellipse_w_normal_dist_of_equivalent_sigma.png) - For one of the trials in #6, co-plots the sampled ellipse distribution vs a normal distribution with the same standard deviation. If you turn on "pause mode" in [ellipse_sampling_fixed_N.m](ellipse_sampling_fixed_N.m) then you can run this trial over and over again and see how it looks for each trial.

For this script, leave pause mode disabled to generate and save #6.  It will also generate and save #7 for the last trial.  Turn pause mode on to see #7 for each trial, and press a key to continue each time.
